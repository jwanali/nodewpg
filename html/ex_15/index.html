              <p>A video posted on Twitter shows a dad reportedly throwing his child at at a a man as he was being escorted out of a stadium in Yokohama, Japan on Tuesday. (@renna_shinohara/Twitter screengrab)

                    Security at baseball games are typically prepared to deal with rowdy fans, banning certain objects from stadiums. But no one could have predicted that anyone would toss a child in a fight at the ballpark.
                    
                    A little boy in Japan was thrown like a rag doll when his dad lost his temper during a baseball game earlier this week.
                    
                    A video clip of the confrontation, which was shared on Twitter by user @renna_shinohara, shows the man being escorted out of the stadium by security guards during a Nippon Professional Baseball game in Yokohama, Japan on Tuesday.</p>
